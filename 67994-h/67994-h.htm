</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have been accustomed to regard
volcanoes such as Vesuvius or Etna as the one
form of volcanic action, may be somewhat startled
by the statement that lavas have sometimes been
poured forth from fissures hundreds of miles in
length, and have deluged vast tracts of country
beneath sheets of molten rock, compared with
which the puny lava-fields of Italy sink into
insignificance. History, romance, and legend have
been so long associated with the group of volcanoes
overlooking the quiet Tyrrhenian Sea, that
from the time when Pindar sung of the fire-floods
of Etna, and Pliny died, too rashly investigating
the great eruption of Vesuvius, till Scrope, Lyell,
Von Buch, and Palmieri made them the centre
of their researches, they have occupied too large
a share of attention, and have been thus regarded
as the full normal development of that volcanic
activity of which they are but a phase, and only
a minor phase. Hence, when, eighteen years ago,
Richthofen described the great lava-plains of
Western America, and attributed their origin to
ejection from fissures, and not from vents, so
firm a hold had been taken of the minds of geologists
by nearly twenty centuries of observation of
Vesuvius and its fellows, that his arguments were
received with incredulity; and though they have
been amply verified by subsequent investigations,
and have afforded the clue to the interpretation
of the vast series of volcanic rocks in other
quarters of the globe, they have not been generally
circulated, and few, outside the circle of
geologists, are acquainted with them.</p>

<p>In this paper, we propose briefly to describe
some of the most noted of these ‘fissure’—or
as Richthofen called them—‘massive’ eruptions,
selecting as types that on the Snake River in
the United States, and those in India, Abyssinia,
and the north-west of Europe; and finally, to
glance at their possible connection with the
form of volcanic excitement more frequently
displayed.</p>

<p>The one which has attracted most attention is
that which formed the plateau of the Snake
River, and which covers altogether, in Idaho,
Oregon, and Washington, an extent of country
equal to France and Great Britain combined.
The district is one wide verdureless waste of
black basalt, stretching westwards from the mountains
by which it is bounded on the north and
east, as an apparently boundless desert, black
and bare, as though it had but recently cooled.
Except for the shifting sand-dunes and slight
ridges of basalt extending like long low waves or
ground swells—to which Professor Geikie compares
them—the surface would be quite level,
the lava having either been poured over a plain,
or having buried the undulations of the country
beneath hundreds of feet of stone. The columnar
structure, so often adopted by basalt, is here
largely developed, and to it is due the tesselated
appearance of the rock, which adds another to
the many striking features in the scenery of the
district. The only river in the district is the
Snake River, which winds its way to the Pacific
through a cañon seven hundred feet deep, and
which is joined, through underground courses,
by the few streams that flow on to the basalt
from the neighbouring mountains, and soon sink
beneath the surface.</p>

<p>The Director-general of the Geological Survey
visited the district five years ago, and his graceful
pen has thus described his first view of
this great lava desert: ‘We had been riding
for two days over fields of basalt level as lake
bottoms among the valleys, and on the morning
of the last day we emerged from the mountains
upon the great sea of black lava which seems
to stretch illimitably westwards. With minds
keenly excited by the incidents of the journey,
we rode for hours by the side of that apparently
boundless plain. Here and there, a trachytic
spur projected from the hills, succeeded now and
then by a valley, up which the black flood of
lava would stretch away into the high grounds.
It was as if the great plain had been filled with
molten rock, which had kept its level, and wound
in and out along the bays and promontories of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">{130}</span>
mountain slopes, as a sheet of water would have
done.’</p>

<p>The feature, however, that most struck Professor
Geikie, as it had done previous observers,
was the absence of ash and scoria, and of any
crater where the eruption could have occurred.
There are indeed a few cinder cones, but they are
analogous—as he says—to the smaller cones on
the flanks of a volcano, or more so to those around
the vapour-vents on the surface of lava-streams.
Such vast masses of lava were certainly not
ejected from these, nor in the ordinary method
of volcanic emission. We are therefore forced
to accept Richthofen’s theory, that they are due
to a series of eruptions from fissures which
stretched across the country for several hundreds
of miles, but are now hidden by the sheets of
stone in which, since no very remote period, the
district has been enwrapped. Geologically speaking,
this must have been recent, as is evidenced
by the lava-floods having covered the present
valleys, and having sealed up the gravel and silt
of their lakes and rivers; but sufficient time has
elapsed to have allowed of the erosion of the
picturesque ravine of the Snake River; and in
so dry a climate and on so hard a rock, this
must have been slow work, though in all probability
it does not carry back the date of the
event beyond the human occupation of the continent.
It is by no means impossible that man
may have witnessed the last of these eruptions
from the summit of the trachyte hills at the base
of which was eddying this ocean of molten
rock.</p>

<p>Another series of volcanic rocks that has long
been a source of perplexity to geologists is that
which, covering two hundred thousand square
miles of India, is known as the Deccan Traps.
Though the separate lava-flows are of no great
thickness, they attain a total of six thousand
feet, exclusive of the ‘intertrappean’ fresh-water
deposits with which they are associated. The
rock is mainly dolerite or basalt, but is very variable,
and in many places it exhibits spheroidal
or columnar structure; unlike, however, that of
the Snake River, volcanic ash is common. The
plateau formed by these deposits consists of a
vast undulating plain, and of flat-topped hills
with occasional ‘scarps’ or cliffs, which in the
Sahyadri range are four thousand feet high, the
whole being marked by terraces along the outcrop
of the horizontal layers of basalt. In many
points, the scenery of this district is much like
that of the Snake River; but, owing to the
greater age of the beds—belonging to the
Cretaceous or chalk group—they are more
weathered, and covered by a thin soil formed
by the disintegration of the rock beneath, bear
a slight vegetation. This, however, heightens the
monotony, as it consists of a simple covering of
straw-coloured grass; though, from March, when
the grass is burnt, till the commencement of the
rainy season in June, the black soil, the black
rocks, and the black ashes of the vegetation,
combine to produce a scene of the most solemn
desolation. The scene can be well viewed from
the railway between Bombay and Nagpur, which
traverses this plateau for five hundred and nineteen
miles without once leaving the lava.</p>

<p>Many ingenious theories have been started to
explain the origin of these lava-fields. Some
writers, as Newbold, hold that the beds were
ejected from submarine volcanoes; but this is
conclusively disproved, since no marine fossils are
associated with them, and as the minute dust—due
to the shattering of the ash and ejected masses
by the sudden cooling—so characteristic a feature
in subaqueous eruptions, is wholly absent. According
to another school, of which Hislop and
Carter were the leaders, the lavas were poured
over the bottom of an enormous lake, in places
‘so shallow as to allow the igneous rock to rise
above its surface into the atmosphere,’ thus giving
rise to beds of ash; but as this assumes the
existence of a vast fresh-water lake hundreds of
miles long and broad and shallow throughout,
for which no evidence has been adduced, this
theory is discredited. One of the latest writers
upon the subject—Mr W. T. Blanford of the
Indian Geological Survey—rejecting the former
hypotheses, argues for the former existence of
volcanic foci in Cutch, in the lower Narbada
valley and near the Sahyadri range, to the east
and north-east of Bombay, though he admits that
if his theory be true, the lava must have flowed
for immense distances, and hence postulates its
excessive fluidity. The possibility, however, of
the rock having done so on a surface quite horizontal,
and in the semi-fluid viscous condition in
which most basic lavas are erupted, presents insuperable
difficulties, and there is now hardly any
doubt that these Deccan Traps were ejected in the
same manner as were those of the Snake River.</p>

<p>For our knowledge of the series of volcanic
rocks that covers the greatest part of Abyssinia,
we are also largely indebted to Mr Blanford,
who explored the district during the expedition
of 1867. These rocks, widespread though they
be, are but the remnants, as are also those of
Arabia, of a fissure eruption that inundated
Abyssinia and Southern Arabia to a depth of
two or three thousand feet.</p>

<p>Nearer home, in North-western Europe, are
the relics of the same form of volcanic activity,
as evidenced by those disconnected patches of
lava-streams and trap dikes, which, scattered
over the north of Ireland, the Highlands of
Scotland, and the northern counties of England,
form such prominent features in the landscapes
of those districts, as in the columnar basalts of
Fingal’s Cave and the Giants’ Causeway, and the
igneous dikes that cross, like walls of rock, the
hills of our northern counties. The area that this
eruption covered was at least one hundred thousand
square miles; while, as it probably extended
to the Faroes and Iceland, it may have been
much larger. We are not left, as in the case of
the Snake River, without evidence as to whence
this mass of rock has come, for, since the
Miocene Age, when it was ejected, denudation
has attacked the district, and sea, stream, and
ice have carried off most of the three thousand
feet of lava that then covered the land, and have
left but a few scattered fragments on which to
reconstruct the record of the event. In doing
so, they have bared the roots of the old fissures
whence this mighty flood must once have welled;
and we thus learn that we must trace its source
to the long dikes that now stretch over the
district, crossing from formation to formation,
and traversing dislocations of thousands of feet
without any break or change. Such dikes can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">{131}</span>
be traced from end to end of the region, from
Donegal to Fife, and from Yorkshire to the
Faroes, increasing in numbers as we approach
the volcanic regions of Antrim and the Hebrides.
They did not all reach and overflow the surface,
as is conclusively proved by Scotch mining operations,
and by the fact that they sometimes disappear,
to rise again elsewhere on the same line.
Such may have been the case with all those of
Yorkshire, as the evidence by which we might
decide has all been swept away. Nevertheless,
we know that a vast district was covered by the
great fire-flood which was poured over the tropical
forest that then flourished on the site of the
Scottish Highlands.</p>

<p>From this brief description of the most important
of these old fissure eruptions, we see
that there is another and a grander phase of
vulcanism than that now displayed either by Vesuvius
or Hecla. This is unquestioned, and the
sphere of speculation is removed to the relation
between the two classes. It is to Richthofen
that we owe the most plausible theory: he considers
these massive eruptions as the fundamental
development, and ‘modern volcanic cones
as merely parasitic excrescences on the subterranean
lava reservoirs, very much in the relation
of minor cinder cones to their parent volcano.’
Thus the form regarded till recently as the one
method of volcanic ejection, appears to be of
but secondary importance, being merely a safety-valve
to relieve the pressure from the lava-sources
below; or may represent but a feebler
and waning condition of that volcanic excitement
of which they have so long been regarded as the
type.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a truism nowadays, in this age of travelling,
that you see a great deal more of people in a
few weeks on board ship at sea together than you
would see in a few years of that vacant calling
and dining and attending crushes which we ordinarily
speak of as society. Nora Dupuy and the
two Hawthorns certainly saw a great deal more
of Dr Whitaker during their three weeks on
board the <i>Severn</i> than they would ever have
seen of him in three years of England or of
Trinidad. Nora had had the young man’s
acquaintance thrust upon her by circumstances,
to be sure; but as the Hawthorns sat and talked
a great deal with him, she was compelled to do
so likewise, and she had too much good feeling
to let him see very markedly her innate prejudice
against his colour. Besides, she admitted
even to herself that Dr Whitaker, for a brown
man, was really a very gentlemanly, well-informed
person—quite an exceptional mulatto, in fact,
and as such, to be admitted to the position of
a gentleman by courtesy, much as Gulliver was
excepted by the Houyhnhnms from the same category
of utter reprobation as the ordinary Yahoos
of their own country.</p>

<p>Most of the voyage was as decently calm as
any one can reasonably expect from the North
Atlantic. There were the usual episodes of flying-fish
and Mother Carey’s chickens, and the usual
excitement of a daily sweepstake on the length
of the ship’s run; but, on the whole, the only
distinct landmarks of time for the entire three
weeks between Southampton and St Thomas were
breakfast, luncheon, dinner, and bedtime. The
North Atlantic, whatever novelists may say, is
not a romantic stretch of ocean; and in spite
of prepossessions to the contrary, a ship at sea
is not at all a convenient place for the free
exercise of the noble art of flirting. It lacks
the needful opportunities for retirement from the
full blaze of public observation to shy corners;
it is far too exposed, and on the whole too
unstable also. Altogether, the voyage was mostly
a monotonous one, which is equivalent to saying
that it was safe and comfortable; for the only
possible break in the ordinary routine of a sea-passage
must necessarily be a fire on board or
a collision with a rival steamer. However, about
two days out from St Thomas, there came a
little relief from the tedium of the daily situation;
and the relief assumed the unpleasant
form of a genuine wild West Indian hurricane.</p>

<p>Nora had never before seen anything like it;
or, at any rate, if she had, she had clean forgotten
all about it. Though the captain had declared
it was ‘too soon’ for hurricanes, this was, in
fact, a very fine tropical tornado of the very
fiercest and yeastiest description. About two
o’clock in the afternoon, the passengers were all
sitting out on deck, when the sea, till then a
dead calm, began to be faintly ruffled by little
whiffs and spurts of wind, which raised here
and there tiny patches of wavelets, scarcely perceptible
to the blunt vision of the unaccustomed
landsman. But the experienced eye of a sailor
could read in it at once a malignant hint of the
coming tempest. Presently, the breeze freshened
with extraordinary rapidity, and before five
o’clock, the cyclone had burst upon them in all
its violence. The rush of a mighty gale was
heard through the rigging, swaying and bending
the masts like sapling willows before the autumn
breezes. The waves, lashed into fury by the
fierce and fitful gusts of wind, broke ever and
anon over the side of the vessel; and the big
<i>Severn</i> tossed about helplessly before the frantic
tempest like the veriest cockboat in an angry sea
upon a northern ocean. Of course, at the first
note of serious danger, the passengers were all
ordered below to the saloon, where they sat in
mute suspense, the women pale and trembling,
the men trying to look as if they cared very
little about it, while the great ship rolled and
tossed and pitched and creaked and rattled in
all her groaning timbers beneath the mad frenzy
of that terrific commotion.</p>

<p>Just as they were being turned off the decks
to be penned up down-stairs like so many
helpless sheep in the lower cabin, Nora Dupuy,
who had been standing with the Hawthorns
and Dr Whitaker, watching the huge and ever-increasing
waves bursting madly over the side
of the vessel, happened to drop her shawl at
starting on to the deck beside the companion-ladder.
At that very moment, a bigger sea than
any they had yet encountered broke with shivering
force against the broadside of the steamer,
and swept across the deck in a drowning flood
as though it would carry everything bodily before
it. ‘Make haste, there!’ the captain called out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">{132}</span>
imperatively.—‘Steward, send ’em all down below,
this minute. I shouldn’t be surprised if before
night we were to have a capful of nasty
weather.’</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, the wave, which had
caught Nora’s shawl and driven it over to the
leeward side, now in its reflux sucked it back
again swiftly to windward, and left it lying all wet
and matted against the gunwale in a mass of
disorder. Dr Whitaker jumped after it instinctively,
and tried to catch it before another
wave could carry it overboard altogether. ‘Oh,
pray, don’t trouble about it,’ Nora cried, in hasty
deprecation. ‘It isn’t worth it. Take care, or
you’ll get wet through and through yourself
before you know it!’</p>

<p>‘The man’s a fool,’ the unceremonious captain
called out bluntly from his perch above. ‘Get
wet indeed! If another sea like that strikes
the ship, it’ll wash him clean overboard.—Come
back, sir; I tell you, come back! No one but
a sailor can keep his feet properly against the
force of a sea like that one!’</p>

<p>Nora and the few other passengers who had
still remained on deck stood trembling under
shelter of the glazed-in companion-ladder, wondering
whether the rash mulatto would really
carry out his foolhardy endeavour to recover
the wrapper. The sailor stood by, ready to
batten down the hatches as soon as the deck
was fairly cleared, and waiting impatiently for
the last lingerer. But Dr Whitaker took not
the slightest notice of captain or sailor, and
merely glanced back at Nora with a quiet smile,
as if to reassure her of his perfect safety. He
stood by the gunwale, just clutching at the shawl,
in the very act of recovering it, when a second
sea, still more violent than the last, struck the
ship once more full on the side, and swept the
mulatto helplessly before it right across the
quarter-deck. It dashed him with terrific force
against the bulwarks on the opposite side; and
for a moment, Nora gave a scream of terror,
imagining it would carry him overboard with
its sudden flood. The next second, the ship
righted itself, and they saw the young doctor
rising to his feet once more, bruised and dripping,
but still not seriously or visibly injured.
The sea had washed the shawl once more out
of his grasp, with the force of the shock; and
instead of rushing back to the shelter of the
ladder, he tried even now to recover it a second
time from the windward side, where the recoil
had again capriciously carried it. ‘The shawl,
the shawl!’ he cried excitedly, gliding once more
across the wet and slippery decks as she lurched
anew, in the foolish effort to catch the worthless
wrapper.</p>

<p>‘Confound the man!’ the captain roared from
his place on the bridge. ‘Does he think the
Company’s going to lose a passenger’s life for
nothing, just to satisfy his absurd politeness!—Go
down, sir—go down, this minute, I tell
you; or else, by jingo, if you don’t, I shall have
you put in irons at once for the rest of the
voyage.’</p>

<p>The mulatto looked up at him with a smile
and nodded cheerfully. He held up his left
hand proudly above his head, with the dripping
shawl now waving in his grasp like a much
bedraggled banner, while with his right he
gripped a rope firmly and steadily, to hold his
own against the next approaching billow. In
a second, the big sea was over him once more;
and till the huge wall of water had swept its
way across the entire breadth of the vessel, Nora
and Marian couldn’t discover whether it had
dashed him bodily overboard or left him still
standing by the windward gunwale. There was a
pause of suspense while one might count twenty;
and then, as the vessel rolled once more to port,
Dr Whitaker’s tall figure could be seen, still
erect and grasping the cable, with the shawl triumphantly
flourished, even so, in his disengaged
hand. The next instant, he was over at the
ladder, and had placed the wet and soaking
wrapper back in the hands of its original possessor.</p>

<p>‘Dr Whitaker,’ Nora cried to him, half laughing
and half pale with terror, ‘I’m very angry
with you. You had no right to imperil your
life like that for nothing better than a bit of a
wrapper. It was awfully wrong of you; and
I’ll never wear the shawl again as long as I live,
now that you’ve brought it back to me at the
risk of drowning.’</p>

<p>The mulatto, smiling unconcernedly in spite
of his wetting, bowed a little bow of quiet acquiescence.
‘I’m glad to think, Miss Dupuy,’ he
replied in a low voice, ‘that you regard my life
as so well worth preserving.—But did you ever
before in all your days see anything so glorious
as those monstrous billows!’</p>

<p>Nora bit her lip tacitly, and answered nothing
for a brief moment. Then she added merely:
‘Thank you for your kindness,’ in a constrained
voice, and turned below into the crowded dining
saloon. Dr Whitaker did not rejoin them; he
went back to his own stateroom, to put on some
dry clothes after his foolhardy adventure, and
think of Nora’s eyes in the solitude of his
cabin.</p>

<p>There is no position in life more helplessly
feeble for grown-up men and women than that
of people battened down in a ship at sea in the
midst of a great and dangerous tempest. On
deck, the captain and the officers, cut off from
all communication with below, know how the
storm is going and how the ship is weathering
it; but the unconscious passengers in their
crowded quarters, treated like children by the
rough seafaring men, can only sit below in hopeless
ignorance, waiting to learn the fate in store
for them when the tempest wills it. And indeed,
the hurricane that night was quite enough to
make even strong men feel their own utter and
abject powerlessness. From the moment they
were all battened down in the big saloon, after
the first fresh squall, the storm burst in upon
them in real earnest with terrific and ever-increasing
violence. The wind howled and whistled
fiercely through the ropes and rigging. The
ship bounced now on to the steep crest of a
swelling billow; now wallowed helplessly in the
deep trough that intervened between each and
its mad successor. The sea seemed to dash in
upon the side every second with redoubled intensity,
sweeping through the scupper holes with
a roar like thunder. The waves crashed down
upon the battened skylights in blinding deluges.
Every now and then, they could hear the cracking
of a big timber—some spar or boom torn off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">{133}</span>
from the masts, like rotten branches from a
dead tree, by the mighty force of the irresistible
cyclone. Whirling and roaring and sputtering
and rattling and creaking, the storm raged on for
hour after hour; and the pale and frightened
women, sitting huddled together in little groups
on the crimson velvet cushions of the stuffy
saloon, looked at one another in silent awe,
clasping each other’s hands with bloodless fingers,
by way of companionship in their mute terror.
From time to time, they could just overhear,
in the lulls between the great gusts, the captain’s
loud voice shouting out inaudible directions to
the sailors overhead; and the engineer’s bell was
rung over and over again, with bewildering frequency,
to stop her, back her, ease her, steady
her, or put her head once more bravely against
the face of the ever-shifting and shattering
storm.</p>

<p>Hour after hour went by slowly, and still
nobody stirred from the hushed saloon. At
eleven, all lights were usually put out, with
Spartan severity; but this night, in consideration
of the hurricane, the stewards left them
burning still: they didn’t know when they
might be wanted for prayers, if the ship should
begin to show signs of sudden foundering.
So the passengers sat on still in the saloon
together, till four o’clock began to bring back
the daylight again with a lurid glare away to
eastward. Then the first fury of the hurricane
began to abate a little—a very little; and the
seas crashed a trifle less frequently against the
thick and solid plate-glass of the sealed skylights.
Edward at last persuaded Marian and Nora to
go down to their staterooms and try to snatch
a short spell of sleep. The danger was over now,
he said, and they might fairly venture to recover
a bit from the long terror of that awful night.</p>

<p>As they went staggering feebly along the
unsteady corridors below, lighted by the dim
lamps as yet unextinguished, they happened to
pass the door of a stateroom whence, to their
great surprise, in the midst of that terrible awe-inspiring
hurricane, the notes of a violin could
be distinctly heard, mingling strangely in a
weird harmony with the groaning of the wind
and the ominous creaking of the overstrained and
rumbling timbers. The sounds were not those
of a regular piece of studied music; they were
mere fitful bars and stray snatches of tempestuous
melody, that imitated and registered the inarticulate
music of the whirlwind itself even as
it passed wildly before them. Nora paused a
moment beside the half-open door. ‘Why,’ she
whispered to Marian in an awestruck undertone,
clutching convulsively at the hand-rail to steady
herself, ‘it must be Dr Whitaker. He’s actually
playing his violin to himself in the midst of all
this awful uproar!’</p>

<p>‘It is,’ Edward Hawthorn answered confidently.
‘I know his stateroom—that’s the number.’</p>

<p>He pushed the half-open door a little farther
ajar, and peeped inside with sudden curiosity.
There on the bunk sat the mulatto doctor,
unmoved amid the awful horse-play of the
careering elements, with his violin in his hands,
and a little piece of paper ruled with pencilled
music-lines pinned up roughly against
the wall of the cabin beside him. He started
and laughed a little at the sudden apparition of
Edward Hawthorn’s head within the doorway.
‘Ah,’ he said, pointing to a few scratchy pencil-marks
on the little piece of ruled paper, ‘you
see, Mr Hawthorn, I couldn’t sleep, and so I’ve
been amusing myself with a fit of composing.
I’m catching some fresh ideas for a piece from
the tearing wind and the hubbub of the breakers.
Isn’t it grand, the music of the storm! I shall
work it up by-and-by, no doubt, into a little
hurricane symphony.—Listen, here—listen.’ And
he drew his bow rapidly across the strings with
skilful fingers, and brought forth from the violin
some few bars of a strangely wild and storm-like
melody, that seemed to have caught the very
spirit of the terrible tornado still raging everywhere
so madly around them.</p>

<p>‘Has the man no feelings,’ Nora exclaimed
with a shudder to Marian, outside, ‘that he can
play his fiddle in this storm, like Nero or somebody
when Rome was burning!’</p>

<p>‘I think,’ Marian said, with a little sigh, ‘he
has some stronger overpowering feeling underneath,
that makes him think nothing of the
hurricane or anything else, but keeps him
wrapped up entirely in its own circle.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next day, when the sea had gone down somewhat,
and the passengers had begun to struggle
up on deck one by one with pallid faces, Dr
Whitaker made his appearance once more, clothed
and in his right mind, and handed Nora a little
roll of manuscript music. Nora took it and
glanced carelessly at the first page. She started
when she saw it was inscribed in a round and
careful copper-plate hand—‘To Miss Dupuy.—Hurricane
Symphony. By W. Clarkson Whitaker,
M.B., Mus. Bac.’ Nora read hastily through the
first few bars—the soughing and freshening of
the wind in its earlier gusts, before the actual
tempest had yet swept wildly over them—and
murmured half aloud: ‘It looks very pretty—very
fine, I mean. I should like some day to
hear you play it.’</p>

<p>‘If you would permit me to prefix your name
to the piece when it’s published in London,’
the mulatto doctor said with an anxious air—‘just
as I’ve prefixed it there at the head of
the title-page—I should be very deeply obliged
and grateful to you.’</p>

<p>Nora hesitated a moment. A brown man!
Her name on the first page of his printed music!
What would people say in Trinidad? And yet,
what excuse could she give for answering no?
She pretended for a while to be catching back
her veil, that the wind blew about her face
and hair, to gain time for consideration; then
she said with a smile of apology: ‘It would
look so conceited of me, you know—wouldn’t
it, Dr Whitaker? as if I were setting myself
up to be some great one, to whom people were
expected to dedicate music.’</p>

<p>The mulatto’s face fell a little with obvious
disappointment; but he answered quietly: ‘As
you will, Miss Dupuy. It was somewhat presumptuous
of me, perhaps, to think you would
accept a dedication from me on so short an
acquaintance.’</p>

<p>Nora’s cheeks coloured quickly as she replied
with a hasty voice: ‘O no, Dr Whitaker; I
didn’t mean that—indeed, I didn’t. It’s very
kind of you to think of putting my name to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">{134}</span>
your beautiful music. If you look at it that
way, I shall ask you as a personal favour to
print that very dedication upon it when you
get it published in London.’</p>

<p>Dr Whitaker’s eye lighted up with unexpected
pleasure, and he answered, ‘Thank you,’ slowly
and softly. But Nora said to herself in her
own heart: ‘Goodness gracious, now, just out of
politeness to this clever brown man, and because
I hadn’t strength of mind to say <i>no</i> to him,
I’ve gone and put my foot in it terribly. What
on earth will papa say about it when he comes
to hear of it! I must try and keep the piece
away from him. This is the sort of thing that’s
sure to happen to one when one once begins
knowing brown people!’</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> powers of customs’ officers in the matter of
wreckage or salvage is a matter of great interest;
and as it is referred to in a recent Report by
Her Majesty’s Commissioners of Customs, a few
notes on the subject may not be out of place.
The whole of the wreck-work in the United
Kingdom is discharged by these officers, under
the general superintendence of the Board of
Trade. All wreck found by any person, except
the owner thereof, is to be delivered up to
the duly appointed person termed the Receiver;
and even if found by the owner, the receiver
is to be apprised of the facts. The receiver
has power, with a warrant from a justice of
the peace, to enter into any house or other
place wherever situated, and there search for,
seize, and detain any wreck he may find. In
all cases, he shall, within forty-eight hours after
taking possession of any wreck, cause to be
posted up at the custom-house in the port nearest
to which such wreck was found or seized, a
description of the same, and of any marks by
which it may be distinguished. In certain
cases, he is, moreover, to transmit a description
of the wreck in his hands to the Secretary of
Lloyd’s in London; and also to any admiral,
vice-admiral, lord of the manor, or other person
having claims for his own use to otherwise
unclaimed wreck.</p>

<p>The work of the receiver includes many transactions
in connection with wreck requiring much
care, tact, and discretion, involving the arrest
and detention of ships and cargoes, on declaration
by salvors of claims to remuneration for salvage
services, ships and cargoes being held under
arrest until salvage claims are settled, or until
proper security is given by bond or otherwise in
satisfaction thereof, as well as the disposal of the
claims of salvors, and the restoration of wreck to
the owners thereof, after satisfying such claims,
other than for salvage, that may be against it.
The receivers are, moreover, authorised to dispose
at once of all wrecked goods of a perishable
nature; and of all other goods at the end of a
year, unless they can be previously disposed of
to the advantage of all persons concerned. In
the performance of his work, the receiver is to
‘endeavour to make himself acquainted with the
persons and characters of the boatmen and others
in the district who are likely to act as salvors or
to find and recover wreck;’ and he is to ‘remember
that the powers of controlling and directing
such persons, and of furthering and adjusting
their claims for salvage, are to be exercised in
such a manner as shall most conduce to the preservation
of life and property, and that he stands
between them on the one hand and the owner
and insurer on the other in an independent and
judicial position.’ It is his special duty, whilst
providing for the claims of bonâ fide salvors, to
protect, so far as his powers permit, owners
against vexatious and improper claims. The
receiver is further required to proceed to any
place in the United Kingdom, either on the shore
or in a tidal river, where any ship may be
stranded or in distress; and there to take
command of all persons present, and issue such
directions as he may deem appropriate for the
preservation of the ship and her apparel, as well
as the cargo and the lives of all persons on
board.</p>

<p>The number of wrecks reported in 1884-85 was
eleven thousand three hundred and seventy-one;
and the number sold or otherwise disposed of,
ten thousand one hundred and thirty-three. The
amount of money received on account of wreck
was twenty-four thousand one hundred and fifteen
pounds; but as much of this amount is received
in very small sums, it does not adequately
represent the very important work performed in
this matter every year by the officers of
Customs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.—CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Wakefield</span> surveyed the group with an
air of stony deliberation, and the sharkiness of
her uneven teeth displayed itself with distinct
unpleasantness. There was a cunning look in
her eyes, a look of hate and greed strangely
blended with avarice.</p>

<p>Mr Carver, after a premonitory cough, addressed
her. ‘Pray, be seated, madam,’ he said
with his severest professional manner. ‘The business
which has brought us here to-day is not
likely to be protracted, and I see no reason why
we should not commence at once. I presume you
would wish to get it over?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ she said; ‘I see nothing to detain
us. I presume the thing is concealed somewhere
in the house.’</p>

<p>‘On the contrary, madam; no. Had such
been the case, doubtless it would have been discovered
long since. I do not suppose you would
have been behindhand in the search; and if I
remember, at the time of my late client’s decease,
no pains were spared to find his effects. I think
that is so?’</p>

<p>Miss Wakefield emitted a grim smile, and
nodded.</p>

<p>‘Very good,’ the lawyer continued—‘very good.—Mr
Slimm, I suppose you have the implements
at hand? Nothing remains now for it but
immediately to set to work and accomplish our
mission. I have seen some extraordinary things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">{135}</span>
in the course of my professional career, but I
must say that since I have had the honour to
be on the rolls, I never encountered anything
like this.’</p>

<p>‘How did it come out?’ asked Miss Wakefield
acidly.</p>

<p>‘Margaret Boulton—you remember her, of
course—she was charged with a paper disclosing
this secret. If I mistake not, it was given her
on the day of Mr Morton’s death.’</p>

<p>Miss Wakefield drew her breath sharply. ‘Had
I but known!’ she said slowly—‘ah, had I but
known!’</p>

<p>There are spots, astronomers inform us, on
the sun—a metaphorical expression which, in the
language of the day, implies that nothing is perfect.
The expression used by Miss Wakefield
therefore proved her to be after all but human,
and, I am afraid, raised a feeling of gratulation
in her listeners’ breasts that she had <i>not</i>
known.</p>

<p>‘We are wasting time here,’ said Mr Carver
shortly.</p>

<p>At this signal, every one rose, and made their
way out of the house, and thence on to the lawn.
They were secluded entirely from observation,
and it was impossible for passers-by to see the
operations. Mr Slimm presently appeared bearing
a pickaxe and spade, and without delay commenced
operations. He was an old miner, and
went to work in a scientific manner, which could
not fail to win the entire approval of the spectators.
Miss Wakefield, who, be it remembered,
was entirely in the dark, watched his proceedings
with a thrilling interest entirely lost in contemplating
the workman.</p>

<p>The spot where they were standing was in
the centre of the lawn, and there stood the
figure of Niobe in the centre. Truly, the last
place to look for a fortune.</p>

<p>Mr Slimm’s first act was to clear away the
weeds and rubbish which had in time sprung
up round Niobe’s feet—a task in which he was
heartily aided by the onlookers, Mr Carver doing
great feats with the thistles; and even Bates
joined in the task, covering himself with distinction
by his desperate onslaught upon sundry
dandelions which time had sown there. This
task being accomplished, the real work commenced.</p>

<p>‘I do not think we need move that ancient
lady,’ said Mr Slimm, touching the Niobe. ‘We
will break earth here in front of her.’</p>

<p>By this time, excitement reigned supreme. Mr
Carver hopped about like an animated cork,
giving the most contrary directions, and sadly
interfering with the task in hand by his well-meant
interference. After narrowly escaping
sudden death from a hearty swing of Mr Slimm’s
pickaxe, he retired to a safe distance, and there
directed the work in safety, giving instructions
which were totally ignored by the worker.</p>

<p>‘I never calculated,’ said the American, as he
worked, ‘to be prospecting for pay dirt on a
gentleman’s lawn. As an ordinary rule, such
is not the place to look for dust. The symptoms
don’t indicate gold,’ he continued, digging away
with great heartiness; ‘but we never can tell
what’s going to turn up, as the philosopher said.
Nothing like faith in these little operations.
Faith, we are told, will remove mountains. It
isn’t a mountain exactly that I want to move;
but this is precious slow work. Perhaps I’m
out of practice, perhaps it’s my impatience, but
this heap don’t seem to be increasing to any
powerful extent. It can’t be very much farther
down, and that’s a fact, or my old comrade must
have been a much more powerful man than I
took him for.’</p>

<p>By this time he had excavated the earth to
some depth, but as yet nothing was visible. He
resumed his task heartily, but as he got deeper
and deeper, his anxiety increased.</p>

<p>‘I hope we are not going to be sold,’ Mr
Slimm said at length.</p>

<p>‘<i>Under</i> the statue, remember,’ said Edgar; ‘you
are going too deep.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you are right,’ replied Mr Slimm,
as he directed a few blows almost viciously at
the side of the hole he had dug. At that
moment the point of the pick struck on some
hard surface. Expectation was on tiptoe, and
the utmost pitch of excitement was reached: in
other words, every one became intensely quiet—if
quiet can be intense—and watched the worker
closely. A few more blows given with hearty
good-will, and the spade plied with equal zest,
brought to light a square box, directly beneath
the statue, but only a few inches underground.
A few touches of the spade completed its liberation,
and Charles Morton’s hiding-place was no
longer an uncertainty, but a pleasant reality.</p>

<p>There, after so long an interment, it lay. The
treasure which had caused so much jealousy and
scheming, disappointment and misery, care and
sorrow, avarice and cunning, was there. For
that money one life had been lost; for that
treasure, two proud hearts had suffered four
years’ misery and deprivation. For that poor
dross, one man’s dying bed was imbittered and
poisoned; for the loss of it, one woman had
wept and raved in vain. Hidden from fear,
found by that mysterious agency poor mortals
call chance, let us hope at last that it is destined
to work some good in a world of tears.</p>

<p>It was no dream. The contents were shaken
out unceremoniously upon the grass, and certified
by Mr Carver. Neat piles of papers and securities,
chiefly American, were wrapped in water-proof,
in a careful manner. Their previous
estimate of Mr Morton’s fortune was found not
to have been far wrong; for when the amount
of the securities came to be counted, the sum
came to no less than thirty-eight thousand five
hundred and ten pounds.</p>

<p>‘Good!’ exclaimed Miss Wakefield, first to
break the silence, and speaking in a voice as
nearly approaching satisfaction as it was possible
for that estimable female to reach. ‘I presume
the rest is merely formal.—Mr Carver, I shall
expect nineteen thousand two hundred and fifty-five
pounds, free of costs, to be paid into my
bankers at once. I certainly take credit for
my generosity in this matter.’</p>

<p>No one answered this remark; the idea of
Miss Wakefield’s generosity being sufficient to
provide every mind with abundance of speculation.
But Mr Slimm’s sharp eye had caught
sight of an envelope, which the others, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">{136}</span>
anxiety to count the spoil, had entirely overlooked.
With a quiet smile upon his lips, he
listened to the last speaker’s gracious remark,
and then handing the paper to Mr Carver, said:
‘I am afraid, madam, we shall have to tax your
generosity still further. If a will was found in
our favour, I think you were to be content
with five thousand pounds. If I don’t mistake,
the paper I have given to our estimable friend
is that interesting document.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Carver was fluttering about in
a state of great jubilation. His first act, as soon
as he had attracted the attention of the group,
was to shake hands with Bates with great and elaborate
ceremony. This gratifying operation being
concluded, he put on his spectacles and said:
‘Bates, I owe you an apology. I spoke of your
intellect disparagingly, I believe, not long since;
and now, in the presence of this distinguished
circle, I beg leave, in all due humility, to retract
my words. It was I who had lost my wits.—No—no
contradictions, please. I say it was I.
The paper I hold in my hand is the last will
and testament of my late client, Charles Morton,
the owner of this house. After giving a few
brief reasons for disposing of his money in this
extraordinary manner, and after a few small
legacies, he says: “And as to the rest, residue,
and remainder of my estate both real and personal,
and of what description or kind soever
and of which I may die possessed, I give and
bequeath to my niece, Eleanor Seaton, for her
absolute use and benefit.” It is signed and
witnessed by John Styles and Aaron Gray, both
names being familiar to me.—Miss Wakefield, I
congratulate you; I do, indeed. You have done
really well.’</p>

<p>It was evident, from the expression of that
lady’s face, that she was very far from sharing
this opinion. Her upper lip went up, and her
saw-like teeth came down in a manner evil to
see. ‘It is a conspiracy!’ she hissed, ‘a low,
cunning conspiracy.—Oh, you shall pay for it—you
shall pay for it. Do you think you are
going to rob me with impunity, with your lawyer
schemes? I will fight the will,’ she screamed,
‘if I am ruined for it. I will ruin you all!
I will have you struck off the rolls! Oh, you
hoary-headed, lying old reptile, you!’</p>

<p>‘Madam,’ said Mr Slimm sternly, ‘you forget
yourself. Do you not know it is in our power
to count the money you have had into the sum
we propose to give you? Have a care—have a
care!’</p>

<p>These last words, uttered with peculiar emphasis,
had a wonderful effect upon the ‘woman scorned.’
With a violent effort, she collected herself, and
when she spoke again, it was without the slightest
trace of her late abandoned, reckless manner.</p>

<p>‘Be it so,’ she said slowly—‘be it so. You are
not likely to hear from me again.—Good-morning.—Mr
Slimm, I see my cab is waiting. If you
will be good enough to give me your arm, I shall
be obliged to you.’</p>

<p>‘One moment,’ said Mr Carver. ‘We do not
propose to deduct the few hundreds you have
from the stipulated sum to be paid to you. You
shall hear from me in a few days.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she replied with strange humility.—‘Mr
Slimm, are you ready?—Again, good-morning.’</p>

<p>When the American returned, his face was
grave and stern. What passed between him
and Miss Wakefield was never known. And
so she passes from our history. Her cunning
and deceit—if it was not something worse—had
availed her nothing. Baffled and defeated, as
vice should always be, she retired to her dingy
lodging, and was never more seen by our friends.
Whether there had been any foul-play was never
known. If the shrewd American had any such
suspicions, he kept them to himself. It was
best, he thought, to let the past dead bury its
dead, and not stir up bitterness and the shadow
of a crime, where nought but peace and sunshine
should be.</p>

<p>Mr Carver was still puzzled. Why his client
should have taken such a strange course with
his money, and why he had not come to him
and made his last will in a straightforward
manner, was a circumstance he could not fathom.
But wiser men than the astute lawyer have been
puzzled ere now by the idiosyncrasies of man,
and Mr Carver was only pondering upon a
subject which has been and will be a theme with
philosophers for all time.</p>

<p>‘Why could he not have come to me?’ he asked
at length.</p>

<p>‘I think it is easily understood,’ explained
Felix; ‘and the principal reason was fear.
According to your own showing, Mr Morton
was moody and fanciful, possessing a highly-strung
nervous system, and easily impressed.
That woman’s stronger will stifled his. I am
under no obligation to her, but she possesses a
mesmeric eye which has a peculiar effect upon
me. Besides this, it is evident he never trusted
her. He must have known, had he communicated
with you, that she would sooner or later
discover it, hence his strange conduct. The
method, to me, savours strongly of a madman’s
cunning. It is proverbial that such men trust
no one.’</p>

<p>‘It is rather idle to speculate upon it now,’
Edgar said cheerfully. ‘Justice has been done
at last, and we are satisfied.’</p>

<p>‘We are all satisfied,’ exclaimed Mr Carver.
‘You have your money, and Bates has his
partnership.—Eh, Bates?’ slapping that individual
with great heartiness on the back—‘eh,
Bates?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so, sir,’ replied that misanthrope
gravely; ‘but the whole matter is highly unprofessional.
There is a lack of business form about
it.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, ah!’ laughed Mr Carver—‘just like Bates;
no sentiment—no poetry’——</p>

<p>‘And no romance,’ put in Edgar.</p>

<p>It was a merry group. Mr Slimm was talking
to Eleanor, making her laugh at his quaint
American saws, and she was telling him of her
strange dream, and how it had all come true.
Edgar and Mr Carver were badgering Bates
upon his gloomy state; and Felix was amusing
and instructing little Nelly with a bewildering,
awe-inspiring fairy tale—the little one, who had
been a silent spectator of the proceedings, and
knew by some childish instinct that some happy
event had happened.</p>

<p>‘Ring down the curtain—the thing is played
out,’ Edgar said; ‘and now back again to London
town, Nelly.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">{137}</span></p>

<p>‘Papa,’ she said after a pause, ‘has some day
come?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, darling.’</p>

<p>‘Really and truly?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, darling. <i>Some</i> day has come at last, little
one.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sunshine and laughter, mirth and joy, instead
of misery and despair, gloom and smoke. Eastwood
again two months later, and high revels
are being held, for is it not little Nelly’s birthday!
The blue sky, flecked with little white
clouds, smiles overhead, and the birds are making
merry in the trees. Niobe still stands in the
centre of the lawn, as ready to keep a secret as
ever, and saying nothing either of the future
or the past.</p>

<p>A pattering throng of little ones are trying
to play at tennis, and Eleanor and her husband
are watching them with amused eyes. Eleanor
looks very sweet and fair to-day, with the light
of happiness in her eyes; and there is an
expression of peace on her face, as she leans
upon her husband’s chair, which is good and
pleasant to see. Mr Bates is looking on at the
group with meditative looks, speculating, no
doubt, upon marriage settlements, which these
little chatterers will want some day. Jolly Mr
Carver is in the midst of a group of little
ones, making himself an object of ridicule and
contempt on account of his lack of knowledge
touching the mysteries of ‘hunt the slipper.’
‘Fancy an old gentleman like that knowing
nothing of the game!’—an opinion which one
golden-haired fairy tenders him without hesitation,
and to which he listens with becoming
humility and contriteness. Noble-hearted Felix
has established a court, where he is doing his
best to emulate the wonders of the eastern storytellers,
and, to judge from the rapt attention
of his audience and the extreme roundness of
their eyes, his imagination is by no means faulty.
Lying full length on the grass, watching the
various groups, is Mr Slimm. There is a depth
of sadness in his eyes to-day, for he is thinking
of another home—that was—thousands of miles
away, and the echo of other voices than these
rings in his ears.</p>

<p>‘I did hope,’ he said, rising up, ‘that I should
spend my old age with my own children; but I
suppose it was not to be.’</p>

<p>‘Do not think of that now,’ Eleanor said with
womanly tenderness.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it is selfish,’ he replied, with a great
heave of his chest. ‘It is all for the best, and I
have my happiness in yours. Had I not lost my
dear ones, I should never have brought you your
joy.’</p>

<p>‘Dear old fellow!’ Edgar said, pressing his
hand warmly. ‘Try and forget that for to-day.
How good providence has been to us!’</p>

<p>‘It is not every man who has a wife like yours,
Seaton,’ replied the American, heedless of the
blushing Eleanor.</p>

<p>‘True for you, old friend,’ Edgar replied, looking
at his wife lovingly. ‘I have one in a million;’
and he kissed her fondly.</p>

<p>The American regarded them for a moment
with something in his eyes suspiciously like
tears. ‘It was not to be,’ he said at length—‘it
was not to be!’</p>

<p>Eleanor came forward and took his hands in her
own. ‘Why not?’ she said. ‘You have always
a home and welcome here. Stay with us, and we
will give to you what we can. Now, promise.’</p>

<p>And he promised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> necessary excavations for an immense sewer
in course of construction at Rome, have laid
bare some interesting relics of the ancient city.
One of these is a tomb, almost perfect in every
respect, which bears an inscription showing that
it was the last resting-place of Sergius, who was
consul in the year 144 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Cicero mentions
Sergius as being a fine orator. The tomb is a
handsome one; and it is intended to remove and

depth of twenty feet below the modern level.
Other relics, separated from the present by an
interval of twenty centuries, have also been laid
bare. Among them is the site of the College of
Medicine, and an inscription bearing the names
of thirty physicians.</p>

<p>Another interesting find has occurred at Ramleh,
near Alexandria. This is the unearthing of an
ancient statue of the great Pharaoh, which was
recently discovered by the chief of the coastguardsmen,
Middlemas Bey, while searching for contraband
tobacco. The statue has not been fully
examined yet. There is little doubt, however, that
it is three thousand years old. It is covered with
hieroglyphics, which will most probably throw
some light upon its history. There is every indication
that the spot where it has been found may
form part of the site of a buried city.</p>

<p>The Exhibition opened some weeks ago under
the auspices of the Geographical Society (London),
has proved a great success, for it has been well
attended. Its object was to show, by exhibiting
the maps, atlases, textbooks, and appliances devoted
to this science by continental countries, and also
by lectures, that the land upon which the sun
never sets is beyond all others the most deficient
in the means of teaching geography. The collection
will presently be exhibited at Manchester,
and afterwards at Edinburgh. It is said that the
Council of the Geographical Society will give a
favourable hearing to any application which may
be made to them for the loan of the collection
for exhibition in other large cities.</p>

<p>M. Daubrie, an authority on meteorites, has
been examining two of these bodies which fell
in India last year. One of them fell at the
village of Pirthalla, in the Punjaub. It weighed
twenty pounds, and had the appearance of granite,
coated with a blackened skin. The other meteorite
fell in the North-western Provinces, and its
fall was accompanied by a flash of light and a noise
resembling thunder. A great deal of interest
has been aroused lately in the subject of meteorites
by the course of lectures which Professor
Dewar has just concluded at the Royal Institution,
London, and which have been addressed
to a juvenile audience. Children of an older
growth as well can hardly fail to be interested
in these mysterious bodies, the only visitors that
come to us from space.</p>

<p>We stated last month in these columns that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">{138}</span>
MM. Paul and Prosper Henry had succeeded in
photographing a portion of the Milky-way. It
has now been suggested by the same eminent
French astronomers that the different observatories
of the world should join hands in the
stupendous undertaking of charting in their true
positions all the stars, about twenty millions,
which are included in the first fifteen magnitudes.
It is calculated that the work might be
accomplished within the present century, if twelve
observatories in different parts of the northern
and southern hemisphere were to undertake it.
About five hundred and ten photographic plates
would have to be taken at each place, and each
plate would require perhaps one night’s attention.
But the only nights available would be
those having no moon and having a clear and
still air. If this work be carried out, its value
to the future of astronomical science will be
incalculable.</p>

<p>A shock of earthquake was felt at about seven
o’clock on the morning of January 20 in Cornwall,
at St Austell and in the neighbourhood.
It appeared as if an explosion had taken place,
so great was the noise, and the sound was immediately
followed by the shaking of the ground.
Persons felt their beds moving under them, and
many others had an impression that a portion
of their house was falling down. The shock
was also felt at Mevagissey. Many people were
shaken in their beds. In one instance a clock
was stopped, and in many houses the doors and
windows shook violently. The inhabitants of
St Blazey and neighbourhood were greatly
startled, about a quarter past seven, by hearing
a loud rumbling noise and by houses being
shaken from foundation to roof. It appeared to
come from a northerly direction, and the vibration
lasted about four or five seconds. Persons
coming in from the outlying districts and giving
an account of the shock being more or less
severe, all agree as to the time of its taking place.</p>

<p>A more important instance of subterranean
activity has been reported to the Admiralty by
the United States government. A submarine
volcano, southward of the Culebras reef, has
suddenly become active, and has thrown up an
island two miles in length and about two hundred
and fifty feet in height. A similar volcano
on the same spot was reported in the year 1877.</p>

<p>From a study of six hundred and fifty thunderstorms
that occurred in Italy in 1881, Signor
Ferrari concludes that every thunderstorm is
connected with a barometric, hygrometric, and
thermic depression; it is behind the two former,
and in front of the last. Most of those storms
arose in the wide plain of the Po. Coming from
west-north-west with a velocity of from eighteen
to twenty-four miles per hour, they passed (in
case of their greatest range) with slackening speed
over the Apennines in Upper and Middle Italy.
For a given moment the thunderstorm has the
form of a long narrow band, advancing, with
numerous bends outwards and inwards, parallel
to itself, and having its various characteristic
phenomena most intense along the middle line.
The dominant wind-direction is generally parallel
to that of propagation of the storm.</p>

<p>M. de Lesseps, with delegates from the
Chambers of Commerce of Paris, Marseilles,
Havre, Rouen, Bordeaux, and Lyons, as well as
representatives from England, Holland, Germany,
&amp;c., whom he has invited to accompany him,
has started for the Panama Canal works. The
object of the journey is to dispel any doubts
as to the completion of the undertaking, and
also to give the representatives of the various
nationalities an opportunity of seeing for themselves
how far the work has progressed. It is
said that there are now twenty-seven contractors
on the works, who are tied down to finish
their sections by certain dates. So many adverse
reports have been circulated as to the real condition
of affairs, that news from competent and
disinterested observers will be looked for with
some anxiety.</p>

<p>A scheme, under influential support, has been
started for the pacification and administration
of that unfortunate part of Africa called the
Soudan. This happy consummation is to be
brought about by the establishment of a chartered
corporation of somewhat the same type as
the defunct East India Company. The nominal
capital of this proposed Company is to be ten
millions, with power to borrow as much more;
and it is further proposed that the English
government, in consideration of having the white-elephant
taken off their hands, should find a
handsome subsidy. The money would be employed
in the development of the country generally,
by the maintenance of roads, railways,
irrigation-works, and other works of public
utility. As the tribes generally have the instinct
of keen traders, it is hoped that these measures
may induce them to ‘turn their swords into
ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks.’
It is hoped, too, that the operations
of the Company may stamp out for ever the
slave-trade of equatorial Africa. The scheme
is a magnificent one; but its success will depend
upon the tact of those who are brought into
contact with the natives.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Taunt, who was employed by the
United States government upon a mission to
the Congo, has recently returned, and gives a
very favourable report as to the healthy infancy
of the free state. With few exceptions, the chiefs
of the different stations are on good terms with
the natives. Cattle are reared with great success,
and fresh meat is therefore abundant, and
the same may be said of European vegetables.
Lieutenant Taunt enjoyed good health, and considers
that there is no reason why other white
men should not do the same, if they will only
exercise common prudence. Upon only one occasion
did the explorer meet with any animosity
from the natives, and this he attributed to the
fact that no station had been established in that
particular district. He considers that it would
be to the interest of the free state if a great
many more stations were established. Finally,
Lieutenant Taunt agrees with Mr Stanley that
on the Congo there are abundant resources to
develop.</p>

<p>We have much pleasure in calling attention
to the Typewriting and General Copying Association,
which for twelve months has been established
for the employment of reduced gentlewomen
at Lonsdale Chambers, Chancery Lane,
London. This worthy little Association has
during its first year been so successful in paying
its way and making a profit on the work done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">{139}</span>
that three new type-writers have been bought
by it. Authors, dramatists, and many others
find it very convenient to have their writings
translated into a form which can be so easily
read. We wish the enterprise continued success.</p>

<p>The miniature hills and vales exhibited by the
wood-pavement of a roadway where there is a
constant traffic, is a familiar sight to dwellers in
our cities. The only remedy hitherto found for
the disease is the relaying of the road with fresh
blocks of wood and a long exhibition of the notice
‘No Thoroughfare,’ while the tedious operation
is going forward. Mr Bicknell, of the Sandycroft
Foundry Company, Chester, has invented a
machine to obviate this inconvenience, and it has
been tried with some success at Manchester. It
has the appearance of a traction-engine, and it
carries before it a revolving disc furnished with
cutters. These cutters pare the road level, after
the manner of a planing-machine, advancing upon
the work at the rate of one foot per minute.</p>

<p>All anglers must be grateful to Mr Henry
Ffennell for the care with which he gathers
and publishes statistics relating to the Salmon
Fisheries. His record for the past year is a very
satisfactory one, for it tells us that fish of large
size have fallen victims to the rod and to the net.
Huge fish of forty pounds weight have been
common, and as usual, the river Tay takes the
lead in the number and weight of its fish. One
angler, Captain Griffith, landed in a single day
thirteen fish of the collective weight of two hundred
and thirty-seven and a half pounds. In
the Dee, a fish of fifty-seven pounds fell to the
rod of the keeper, and a fish of the same weight
was taken in Ireland, on the Shannon. On the
Dee, it is reported that netting in the lower
reaches has been carried on to such an extent that
the upper proprietors who do so much to nurse
the fish during their tender infancy are becoming
quite disheartened. The same complaint comes
from the water-bailiffs on the upper portion of
the Severn fishery. But here, it seems that the
fish have other remorseless enemies in the otters,
who of late years have increased in numbers to
an alarming extent. These voracious hunters
do not content themselves with simply killing
a salmon now and then to supply their larders,
but prefer, as their habit is, to eat a piece out
of the shoulder, leaving the rest of the carcase
untouched. As many as six or seven dead fish
have been found in one place mutilated in this
manner.</p>

<p>‘Horses of the Past and Present’ was the subject
of a most interesting lecture given lately at
the London Institution by Professor Flower, who,
it will be remembered, succeeded Professor Owen
as Director of the Natural History Museum at
South Kensington. He pointed to the tapir as
one of the earliest known ancestors of the horse,
and showed that the family group to which
the horse belonged had undergone great modifications.
The changes which had gradually taken
place in the horse consisted principally in a great
increase of size, especially in the length of the
neck and certain structural alterations in the
bones. The teeth and the feet exhibit the most
marked alterations from previous types, alterations
which have been induced by conditions
of life. The lecturer held that the domestic
horse is undoubtedly derived from the wild
species of Europe and Asia, but there is no
means of arriving at the time when domestication
took place.</p>

<p>The opening, last month, of the tunnel beneath
the Mersey, which connects Liverpool with Birkenhead,
marks the successful completion of one
of the great engineering achievements of modern
times. The boring differs from an ordinary railway
tunnel in consisting of three separate passages
through the solid rock. The lowermost of these
is a drainage ‘heading’ eight feet in diameter.
Seven feet above this comes the main tunnel,
twenty-six feet in diameter, through which the
trains are now continually passing, and lastly, by
its side runs the ventilating tunnel, seven feet in
diameter. This last heading is a most important
feature of the works. Revolving fans, forty feet
in diameter, at each end of this ventilating tunnel,
cause the air to be changed continually in the
main heading, so that passengers breathe air as
pure as that they have left behind them above
ground. Those who have travelled in the choking
atmosphere of the Metropolitan Underground
Railway will be able to appreciate the importance
of this provision for fresh air. Golfers, too,
who reside in Liverpool and who frequent the
delightful Links of Hoylake, in Cheshire, will
doubtless appreciate the convenience of being
taken there and back minus the ferry-boat passage.</p>

<p>It would seem almost an impossibility that snow
could attach itself to and accumulate upon a
strong metal wire suspended in mid-air, to such an
extent as to cause that wire to snap by reason of
the extra burden imposed upon it. But recurring
snowstorms teach us that this is what happens
to many of our telegraph wires, to the great
and serious injury of communication all over the
country. One of the officials of the telegraph
department has been at the pains to weigh a portion
of the frozen snow which fell from a wire,
upon which it had covered a space of one foot.
The mass weighed just upon one pound. Now,
as the supporting posts of such a wire are commonly
two hundred feet apart, it is readily seen
that a wire may be called upon by a snowstorm
to support an extra weight of two hundred pounds.
More than this, a wire so circumstanced may form
one of two dozen or more supported on the same
set of poles, and these supports naturally succumb
to the unusual load. The remedy is obvious;
wires should, whenever possible, be laid beneath
the ground, and our postal authorities are carrying
out that principle as far as they can.</p>

<p>Another advance in photography is represented
by a process invented by M. Thiebaut, which has
recently been described before the Photographic
Society of Great Britain. In this process the glass
plate which usually forms the support of the
photographic film is superseded by a sheet of
cardboard. In other words, the sensitive mixture
of silver bromide and gelatine is spread upon
sheets of cardboard. After the picture is developed,
the film is separated from its support, and
can be printed from by the sun in the usual way.
The advantage of this process is that a tourist
can carry with him the material for a gross of
pictures, while the weight is only about that of
a dozen of the usual glass plates. More than this,
several negatives when complete can be stored
away in a very small space.</p>

<p>The great painter Van Dyck, while journeying
to Italy, fell sick at the village of St Jean de
Maurienne, in Savoy, and was carefully nursed
until convalescent by the family of one of the
chief residents. As some return for the kindness
he received, Van Dyck painted the portrait of
one of the children of his host, and left the
picture behind him. This picture has been for
a long time known to exist, but where it had
gone to, nobody could tell. It has at last
been discovered, and it is probable that the
directors of the Brussels gallery will endeavour
to purchase this precious relic of the great
master.</p>

<p>The machinery devised for producing cold air,
and hitherto exclusively used for freezing meat
and other perishable things, has lately been
employed in Stockholm for quite another purpose.
A tunnel has been in course of construction
there which passes through a hill, the soil
of which is of a wet, gravelly nature. Upon
this hill stand many buildings, which would have
been in great danger if the work had proceeded
without some means being taken of supporting
their foundations. Underpinning was considered
too expensive; so the contractor hit upon the
entirely novel plan of freezing the wet gravel
into a solid icy concrete. The plan has answered
admirably, and many of the houses are being
tunnelled under with perfect safety.</p>

<p>The professors of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary
have adopted a new form of stretcher, the
invention of Mr R. Stevens, who is an engineer
employed at the institution. The apparatus consists
of a canvas sheet, with carrying-poles on
each side, attached to the ends of which are iron
cross-bars, to prevent the poles coming too near
together, and providing therefore a sufficient
space between them for the patient under removal.
But the chief feature of the new contrivance,
and one which must prove very valuable in some
cases of injury is, that the patient can be laid
on a bed without being lifted from the stretcher.
This end is accomplished by making the canvas
sheet in two parts, but secured by a cord or a
rod passed through loopholes at the place of
junction. When the stretcher, with the patient
on it, is placed on the bed, this cord or rod can
be readily removed, and the stretcher falls in
two halves, leaving the patient comfortable.</p>

<p>We have already noticed the wonderful antiseptic
properties of boracic acid in the article
‘<a href="https://gutenberg.org/files/66983/66983-h/66983-h.htm#OCCASIONAL_NOTES">Borax</a>’ (<i>Journal</i>, January 9th). An interesting
testimony as to its properties for preserving
fresh fish comes from Norway. Writing in the
<i>Scotsman</i>, Professor J. Cossar Ewart draws attention
to the fact that between four and five
thousand barrels of herrings preserved by means
of a mixture of this substance and salt, have
been arriving weekly from Norway; and last
winter, over twenty thousand barrels found
their way into the English market. Cargoes
delivered before Christmas had a ready sale
at twenty-eight shillings per barrel. The same
writer indicates how the boracic acid may be
applied in the preservation of fish. For preserving
herrings, the best plan seems to be a
mixture of powdered boracic acid and fine salt.
The mixture having been made, the fresh herrings
should be arranged in layers in a barrel in
exactly the same way as cured herrings are packed,
and each tier covered with a thin layer of the
mixture. When the barrel is full, it should be
tightened down in the ordinary way and then
‘pickled’ with a weak solution of boracic acid.
For treating a barrel of herrings in this manner,
two and a half pounds of acid and five pounds of
salt are required for spreading on the tiers of
herrings during packing, and about ten ounces of
pure acid for dissolving in the fresh water used
for pickling. The boracic acid may be had for
less than sixpence a pound.</p>

<p>Dr Riley, Entomologist to the United States
Agricultural Department, has presented his collection
of insects to the United States. It is said
to contain one hundred and fifteen thousand
specimens of twenty thousand species or varieties
of insects.</p>

<p>In Germany, an unusual number of white
varieties of animals are noticed this winter. A
white chamois was shot in the Totengebirge, a
white otter was caught near Luxemburg, white
partridges were shot near Brunswick, and a white
fox was killed in Hessen.</p>

<p>In the eleven years from 1873 to 1884, the
number of lions killed in Algeria was two hundred
and two, for which a premium of four
hundred pounds has been paid by the government.
The number of panthers destroyed in the
same period is twelve hundred and fourteen, and
the money paid by the government seven hundred
and twenty pounds. About four hundred
pounds has been paid for eighteen hundred and
eighty-two hyenas, and sixteen hundred pounds
for twenty-seven thousand jackals. The large
felidæ are almost extirpated principally in the
western provinces, and the lion of the desert is
fast becoming a thing of the past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_BARRACK_GHOST_STORY">A BARRACK GHOST STORY.</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">Prisoner</span>, have you any objection to be tried
by me as president, or by any member of this
court-martial?’ asked the field-officer who had
been detailed for the duty of presiding over the
court.</p>

<p>‘No, sir,’ I answered; for it was my most
unenviable situation that morning to be brought
to the courtroom for trial, having been ‘put
back’ by my commanding officer a few days
before on a charge of having been asleep on my
post while on sentry; an offence characterised
in my indictment as ‘conduct in prejudice to
good order and military discipline.’</p>

<p>The members composing the court were then
sworn, and the trial proceeded in the cumbrous
fashion peculiar to military tribunals, the president
laboriously writing down every word of
the evidence as it was uttered. The sergeant
who had been in charge of the guard at the
time of my alleged offence was the principal
witness against me, and he began to describe,
with grotesquely ungrammatical volubility, how
he had found me stretched on the ground asleep;
but was at once pulled up short by the president,
who ordered him to say what he had to
say in as few words as possible.</p>

<p>‘Was the prisoner sober?’ asked one of the
officers when the sergeant had finished his evidence.</p>

<p>‘Quite sober, sir,’ replied the man of stripes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">{141}</span></p>

<p>The men who composed the relief having corroborated
the sergeant’s statement, I was called
upon for my defence.</p>

<p>I therefore narrated to the court, that shortly
before my two hours on duty had expired, I
saw a white figure carrying a drawn sword pass
close to my post; and that, being of a nervous,
excitable temperament, I was so frightened that
I fell to the ground in an unconscious state, and
only recovered when I was roused by the sergeant
of the guard.</p>

<p>‘Prisoner,’ remarked the president, ‘in my
twenty years’ experience of the army, I have
served on numerous courts-martial, and have
heard all kinds of ingenious defences put forward
by men in your present position in excuse of
the offences with which they were charged; but
your line of defence is the most remarkable
that has come under my observation. Who,
do you think, will credit a story of that
description? Assuredly not I, for one.—Now,
prisoner,’ continued the major in a kindly
tone, ‘I must advise you that your action in
submitting to the court a statement of that
description is extremely injudicious. You will
do yourself a positive injury by persevering in
it, not only with regard to the probable extent
of your punishment, but also to your reputation
as a soldier. It will be far better for you
simply to own that you were asleep. You are
a young man who has served but six months
in the regiment; so, under the circumstances,
assuming that you adopt my suggestion, which
is assuredly meant for your good, the court may
think fit, consistently with the duty demanded
of it by the hard and fast requirements of military
law, to recommend a much lighter sentence
of imprisonment than would be administered to
an older and more experienced member of the
service.’</p>

<p>‘I can only tell the truth, sir,’ I urged.</p>

<p>‘That, then, is your defence—that you were
frightened by the figure you saw?’ asked the
officer in a tone of vexation.</p>

<p>‘That is my defence, sir,’ I replied.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said the president, writing down
my statement.—‘Escort, remove the prisoner.—Stop!
About his character? Call the captain of
his company.’</p>

<p>My captain answering the summons, stated
that my conduct had been most exemplary;
after which I received the command: ‘Left
turn, quick march!’ and was removed to the
guardroom; and the members of the court-martial
began their deliberations on the duration of
the period of imprisonment which they meant to
administer to me.</p>

<p>I shall now relate the facts in connection with
the appearance of the ‘figure’ before alluded to.
At one o’clock on the morning of my arrest, I
was posted on sentry in front of a wall which
had been built on the face of a cliff overhanging
the beach. Why that particular spot
required guarding, when any attempt on the
part of a soldier to break out of barracks would
be equivalent to committing suicide, as the rock
had a sheer unbroken descent of one hundred
and fifty feet, was a matter of puzzling speculation
to the men of all the regiments which in
turn occupied the quarters I refer to. A tradition,
however, which was retailed to me by an
aged veteran who officiated as a barrack labourer,
threw some light on the subject. Many years
before, the colonel of a regiment which was about
to leave the town in order to embark for India,
placed a sentry on the spot, to prevent his men
from throwing over the cliff the rubbish that
accumulates in changing quarters; and the relieving
regiment finding this man on duty, had supplied
his place without troubling themselves
about the why and wherefore; the post became
in consequence a permanent institution, and a
sentry guards the wall to this day.</p>

<p>The morning on which I was on guard
was exceedingly cold and frosty. The moon
shone brightly, throwing the dark shadow of the
adjoining officers’ quarters half-way across the
parade-ground in front. In the valley beneath I
could see distinctly every gable and chimney of
the houses of the old-fashioned town that nestled
so cosily in the hollow between the precipitous
cliffs. The moon was reflected brightly in
the ocean to the south, and by its light I could
even see the glittering bayonet of the sentry who
guarded the government stores on the pier, a mile
distant. Our gallant soldiers on duty, however,
have but little regard for the picturesque; and
like most men similarly situated, I was wearying
for the termination of my two hours’ vigil, and
little inclined to admire the surrounding scenery.
At length the clock struck three; and I was at
once filled with a feeling of cheery satisfaction
at the immediate prospect of being relieved, and of
returning to the warm guardroom and drinking
a cup of hot coffee before turning off to sleep.</p>

<p>I heard the sentry on the gate lustily shout
‘Sentry-go!’ as a summons for the relief to turn
out; and just as I was preparing to take a last
turn on my post, I perceived, at the extremity of
the shadow cast by the officers’ quarters, a ghostly
figure in a long white robe, bearing in its hand
a drawn sword. I endeavoured to shout for
assistance, but was so ‘harrowed with fear and
wonder,’ that I was unable to articulate a single
word, but stood perfectly transfixed, staring at
the apparition. It moved slowly past me;
but when it turned round and raised its disengaged
hand to its white head-covering, as if
in salute, its aspect so filled me with terror,
that being, as I mentioned before, of a nervous
temperament, I fell to the ground, and only
recovered consciousness when, a minute or two
afterwards, I was vigorously shaken up by the
sergeant of the guard.</p>

<p>That non-commissioned officer along with the
men of the relief laughed heartily when I described
the fright I had received, and remarked
that I had been dreaming. The sergeant, however,
performed the duty required of him by the
rules of discipline in a most inexorable fashion.
He deprived me of my arms and belts, and confined
me in the prisoners’ quarters in the guardroom.</p>

<p>Next day, I was taken before the commanding
officer, a hot-headed Welshman, whom I shall call
Colonel Morgan, charged with having been asleep
on my post. To him I related particulars of the
mysterious figure I had seen; but my statement,
instead of proving a satisfactory excuse for my
offence, as I hoped it would, threw the worthy
colonel into a state of great indignation, and he
at once remitted me for trial by court-martial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">{142}</span></p>

<p>On the third day after the sitting of the court,
I was informed that my sentence would be promulgated
at forenoon parade. With a sinking
heart, I heard the ‘assembly’ sounded, then the
‘fall in;’ and shortly afterwards the band played
merrily, as if in mockery of my agitation.</p>

<p>Escorted by a file of the guard, I marched to
the centre of the hollow square into which the
regiment had been formed; and the adjutant
read out my sentence, which was, that I should
be imprisoned with hard labour for a period of
eighty-four days. Appended to the confirmation
of the proceedings of the court-martial by the
general commanding the district was a note to the
following effect: ‘Considering the nature of the
prisoner’s defence, which was calculated to excite
an uneasy feeling among the men of his regiment,
I consider the punishment inflicted quite inadequate
to the enormity of his offence.’</p>

<p>The next day, I was escorted, handcuffed, to
a military prison about six miles distant, where,
after having been medically examined and weighed,
I was introduced to a most select assemblage of
erring brethren of the sword, who were engaged
in the exhilarating occupation of picking oakum,
alternated with the agreeable muscular exercise
of ‘shot’-drill.</p>

<p>The humiliating and degrading situation in
which I found myself, through no fault of my
own, made me, naturally enough, deeply regret
my folly in having joined the army, and excited
within me many unpleasant reflections on the
good prospects in civil life which I had thrown
to the winds. Like Mickey Free’s father, in
Lever’s <i>Charles O’Malley</i>, I heartily ejaculated:
‘Bad luck to the hand that held the hammer
that struck the shilling that listed me!’</p>

<p>Now for the sequel to my ghost story, which
was related to me when I was released from
durance vile.</p>

<p>Between two and three o’clock on the morning
of the day after I was taken to prison, a man
came screaming into the guardroom of the barracks,
exhibiting symptoms of the most extreme
terror, and declaring that he, too, had seen the
figure while on sentry; and his description of its
appearance was precisely similar to mine.</p>

<p>The sergeant of the guard at once rushed to
the officers’ quarters, woke up the adjutant, and
informed him of the ghost’s alleged reappearance.
A hue-and-cry was at once instituted; and the
orderly sergeants having been roused, a ‘check-roll’
was called, to ascertain whether any man
had left his room for the purpose of playing a
practical joke. Every nook and cranny in barracks,
from the officers’ quarters to the wash-houses,
were rigidly examined; but the spectre
had apparently vanished into thin air, leaving
all the regiment in a state of unpleasant
suspense.</p>

<p>‘What’s all the row?’ shouted the colonel
from the window of his room, he having been
awakened by the unusual commotion in barracks.</p>

<p>‘The ghost has appeared again, sir,’ replied
the adjutant.</p>

<p>‘Have you caught him?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir.’</p>

<p>‘If you do, put him, white sheet and all, in
the guardroom. I should very much like to see
the gentleman,’ remarked the colonel as he closed
the sash of his window and returned to bed.</p>

<p>That morning, at orderly hour, Colonel Morgan
remitted the unfortunate fellow who, like me,
had been scared by the mysterious visitant, for
trial by court-martial, declaring that he would
put an effectual check on these absurd fancies
of the sentries; and immediately before the usual
parade he delivered a most characteristic warning
to the regiment on the subject. After describing
the condign punishment which any practical
joker, whether officer or private, might expect if
caught in the act of playing the ghost, the commanding
officer furiously exclaimed: ‘When a
soldier is on duty, I expect that he will stick to
his post, even supposing the Evil One himself
should make his appearance; and I will try by
court-martial any man who dares to act contrary
to my express injunctions.’</p>

<p>That afternoon, however, when the guard
mounted, the adjutant privately gave orders that
the oldest soldier should be detailed for the
second relief on the haunted post; and this
selection fell on a brawny Yorkshireman, a Crimean
and Indian veteran named Sykes. Sykes
at once intimated it as his intention to have
a shot at the spectre; and being filled with a
superstitious belief in the efficacy of a silver
bullet when fired at a visitor from the world
of spirits, vowed that he would hammer up his
day’s pay of sixpence and place it in a cartridge,
to make sure of ‘doing for’ the ghost, even
although he knew the operation referred to
would spoil the price of a quart of beer.</p>

<p>The sergeant of the guard having seriously
inquired at the adjutant, whether, in the event
of the figure again making its appearance, the
sentry would be empowered to fire at it—</p>

<p>‘I think not,’ the officer laughingly observed.
‘If it is a real ghost, then I’m afraid a bullet
won’t be of much service. If it is a practical
joker, then we’ll make it “hot” enough for him
without shooting him.’</p>

<p>That evening at mess, the appearance of the
spectre was the general theme of conversation
among the officers; but all of them, however,
expressed their incredulity with regard to the
story. A few of the youngsters, whose curiosity
was strongly excited on the subject, made up
their minds to keep watch beside the sentry,
so as to pounce on the spirit when it made its
appearance, and arranged to take with them a
pet bulldog belonging to the colonel, to assist
in the operation.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you join us, sir?’ asked a young ensign,
addressing the commanding officer.</p>

<p>‘I think not,’ he replied. ‘I am tired, and
shall go to bed. If you catch the ghost—which
I suspect is likely to be one of the men—clap
him in irons and put him in a cell. I’ll attend
to him to-morrow.’</p>

<p>When Colonel Morgan left the messroom, he
visited the haunted post before retiring to his
quarters, which were close at hand. After replying
to the sentry’s challenge, he asked Sykes:
‘Have you seen anything as yet?’</p>

<p>‘Not yet, sir,’ replied the man.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think that it is likely you will either,’
remarked the colonel with a laugh as he retired
to his room.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, when the clock struck two,
the young officers left the messroom and cautiously
stole over the barrack square to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">{143}</span>
place where ‘the spirit held his wont to walk.’
Poor Sykes was very glad of their company;
for, though he was a man of undoubted pluck,
and greatly respected in the regiment for his
pugilistic prowess, he was not at all bright at
the prospect of tackling the ghost all by himself.
He paced about on his post, keeping a
sharp lookout, and the officers crouched under
the shadow of the wall; while the dog took
up its quarters in the sentry-box. A little
before three, they were startled by the abrupt
appearance of the apparition, which carried as
before a drawn sword.</p>

<p>‘Who comes there?’ shouted Sykes, bringing
his rifle to the ‘charge.’</p>

<p>The spectre made no answer, but slowly raised
its left hand to its forehead.</p>

<p>The dog, with a loud growl, sprang out of the
box and rushed open-mouthed at the figure; but
when he approached it, he began to wag his tail,
and evinced symptoms of great satisfaction. The
officers and the sentry at once surrounded the
ghost, and found, to their most intense astonishment,
that it was no other than Colonel Morgan
himself, attired in his night-dress, in a state of
somnambulism!</p>

<p>Aware of the danger of waking him while
in that condition, they followed him to his room,
whither he almost immediately returned, and
there they saw him sheathe his sword and
return to bed seemingly oblivious of their presence.</p>

<p>Next morning, he was apprised of the circumstances
of the case; and the poor colonel
was naturally very much concerned on learning
the nature of the malady of which he had been
an unconscious victim. Of course his first action
was to write an explanation to the general, with
a request for my release; and his next, to
publish in regimental orders his regret for the
trouble he had unwittingly occasioned.</p>

<p>Several red-tape formalities had to be gone
through; and it was some days before I was
astonished and delighted by an intimation from
the prison governor that I was free; and was
handed over to the charge of a corporal, who
had been sent to bring me to my regiment.
Whenever I entered the barracks, I was ordered
to proceed at once to the commanding officer’s
quarters. Colonel Morgan shook hands with
me, and expressed his extreme concern that he
had been the innocent cause of my having been
subjected to such ignominy.</p>

<p>‘No wonder that I frightened you, my lad,’ he
observed with a smile. After informing me that
he was about to proceed on leave—with the
intention of undergoing a course of medical
treatment to cure him of his dangerous propensity
to walk in his sleep—he presented me
with five pounds by way of solatium; and
further gratified me by saying, that having
ascertained I was of good character and well
educated, he had that day placed me in orders
as having been appointed lance-corporal. ‘Always
behave yourself, my lad, and I shan’t forget
you,’ said the colonel; and I left his quarters
perfectly overjoyed with my good-luck, scarcely
believing that the pleasant, affable, kindly gentleman
with whom I had conversed was the hectoring,
bullying commander, who was the terror
of his regiment.</p>

<p>The colonel faithfully kept his word to me.
When he rejoined the corps, completely cured
of his complaint, I was promoted rapidly; and
eight years subsequently, through the influence
of my patron, General Morgan, I was gazetted as
quartermaster of my regiment.</p>

<h3>SMALL MOTORS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advantages of mechanical power have
never been more appreciated than at the present
time, when trade depression enforces economy in
every industry and branch of production. Attention
has accordingly been keenly directed of late
towards that class of prime movers known as
‘small motors,’ deriving their power either from
some central supply, or themselves generating
the motive energy. A wide field undoubtedly
lies open to such motive force, not merely in
the domestic operations—pumping water for
house-supply, driving, sewing, and culinary
machinery—but also in such industrial work as
cutting, chopping, grinding, churning, and sawing;
in addition to the numberless requirements of
the smaller manufactories and workshops.</p>

<p>Gas-engines have already reached a high stage
of perfection, and in towns where gas can be
procured at a moderate cost, large numbers of
these motors are actively and advantageously
employed in the various operations just enumerated.
The production of the gas at one central
source, prior to its distribution, is, it may be
remarked, on economical grounds, a very perfect
arrangement, for the loss incidental to a series
of small producers is avoided. A similar law
holds true of steam, it being well known that
a number of small engines driven from one large
boiler give a considerably higher duty than if
each engine had its own small boiler.</p>

<p>The employment of water-pressure has of late
received considerable impulse; and in large cities,
systems of high-pressure supply are now laid
down. The power is supplied from accumulators
worked by pumping-engines at central stations,
and a pressure of one thousand pounds per
square inch is not unfrequently maintained in
the mains. For lifts and hydraulic hoists, this
system of transmitting power has been eminently
successful; for other purposes, it has not as
yet realised the expectations of its introducers,
mainly, it is asserted, from difficulty in obtaining
a satisfactory motor which shall transform the
pressure into motion.</p>

<p>Cost of production has as yet debarred electricity
from competing commercially as a transmitter
of power; viewing, however, the extraordinary
progress recently made, it would be
rash to assert how much further a comparatively
near future may not bring us, if we would read
the future by the past.</p>

<p>Recently, a vacuum-engine has been produced,
which attracted considerable attention at the
Inventions Exhibition, and from what has been
achieved in a very short time, promises well.
Amongst the advantages claimed for this engine
is the fact that once started, no further attention
is requisite for many hours. By an ingenious
use of gun-metal in the cylinder, valves, &amp;c.,
lubrication is rendered unnecessary; whilst, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">{144}</span>
means of a hopper boiler, the furnace is self-feeding.
Explosion is, of course, impossible, the
engine working below atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>This engine has been employed in small
electric-light installations; and from its regular
motion and the ease with which it is managed,
is undoubtedly eminently adapted for this class
of work; whilst the smallness of its coal-consumption
and the high duty attained have procured
the highest awards at the hands of all
juries who have examined it.</p>

<p>In the future of ‘small motors,’ a future that
appears an extended one, this new vacuum
motor will doubtless play a not unimportant part.</p>


<h3>A BOOK OF CLAN TARTANS.</h3>

<p>Whether the kilt did or did not form part
of the ‘garb of old Gaul’ may be left for the
discussion of antiquaries, but there can be no
doubt about the antiquity of tartans. As is well
known, the various clans in the Scottish Highlands
were distinguished from each other not
only by their names, their badges, their war-cries,
but also by the particular pattern and
colour of the tartan which they wore. In the
magnificently printed volume just issued by
Messrs W. &amp; A. K. Johnston, entitled <i>The Tartans
of the Clans of Scotland</i>, lovers of the Highland
garb will be delighted by the splendid reproduction
in colours of the tartan of seventy-one
clans or septs. Nothing can excel the accuracy
and beauty with which the cloth, both in colour
and texture, has been imitated in these plates.
Each plate, moreover, is accompanied by a few
notes on the clan to which the particular tartan
appertains.</p>


<h3>THE INFANT BAND OF PORT JACKSON.</h3>

<p>There is at present lying in Port Jackson,
Australia, a training-ship called the <i>Vernon</i>, and
some of the boys who have musical ability are
regularly trained in the study of music, with the
view to becoming efficient musicians, and thereby
able to take their place in military or orchestral
bands. So small are these children, that it has
been jokingly said half a dozen of them could
readily be accommodated in their own big
drum; whilst the grand ophicleide would afford
a comfortable lodging for one or two at least!
But small as they are, their playing is one of
the wonders of the neighbourhood, and the
delight of all who have had the good fortune
to hear them. These diminutive artists execute
classical music, as well as music of
a lighter character, with a vigour and precision,
and a finished taste and expression that
are nearly incredible, and should be heard to be
believed. In fact, many an ordinary military
band might well take a lesson from them in the
grace and point with which they play, and also
in the perfect tune and delicacy of tone of all
their instruments—virtues that are not common
to boys’ bands; extreme roughness, want of tune
and tone, and total absence of grace or expression,
being the usual failings of juvenile players. That
the <i>Vernon</i> band is carefully taught, and trained
with the utmost care and skill, there can be little
doubt; and great credit is due to the directors
and commander of the vessel, which, apart from
the unrivalled band, is a model as regards drill,
discipline, order, and cleanliness. The <i>Vernon</i>
is maintained entirely at the cost of the state, not
by private subscriptions, donations, or rates.</p>


<h3>DAIRY EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>Lord Vernon, who was last year President of
the British Dairy Farmers’ Association, made a
proposal for the institution of experiments, with
the object of solving the following questions:
(1) What is the smallest quantity of food upon
which stall-fed cattle can be successfully and
economically kept? (2) To what extent does a
further supply of food repay its cost in the
enhanced value of the milk? (3) What relation
should the constituents of the food have to
each other to produce milk, butter, and cheese?
It was suggested that these experiments should
be carried out under the superintendence of a
Committee of the British Dairy Farmers’ Association;
and Lord Vernon, who undertook to provide
everything necessary for their use, desired
that any information obtained should be published
for the benefit of those connected with
dairy-farming.</p>
